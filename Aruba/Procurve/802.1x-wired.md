# Setting up a port for 802.1x <br>

To use Clearpass with fingerprinting and MAC Address Bypass (MAB), the switch must be setup to send 802.1x requests to the Clearpass server and the port must be configured for 802.1x.  <br>

## configure the switch for dynamic segmentation using teh Clearpass server<br>
NOTE: In this example there are two ClearPass servers in a pair 172.16.120/172.16.1.21 and the VIP is 172.16.1.22<br>

Here are two aliases that you can use to show aaa settings
```
alias aaa "show run | in aaa"
alias "cppm" "show port-access clients"
```
After entering the alias in global configuration mode you just have to tpye "aaa" [enter] and the alias will output the aaa configuration.<br>

There are some more aliases here [aliases](https://github.com/rikosintie/CookBook/blob/main/Aruba/Alias.md)

## Adding aaa to ports 1-48

```
aaa port-access authenticator 1-48 tx-period 10
aaa port-access authenticator 1-48 supplicant-timeout 10
aaa port-access authenticator 1-48 client-limit 2
aaa port-access authenticator active
aaa port-access mac-based 1-48
aaa port-access mac-based 1-48 addr-limit 2
aaa port-access authenticator 1-48
```



## Removing AAA from a port
If you have a device that cannot be used with 802.1x for some reason, you can remove the commands from just one port. <br>
The "no" form of the commands doesn't work to remove aaa from a port, you have to set the value to the default. <br>
NOTE: Must be run from global configuration mode. If you are in an interface configuration mode they will fail.

Here are the commands needed to remove aaa from port 48:

```
no aaa port-access authenticator 48
aaa port-access authenticator 48 tx-period 30
aaa port-access authenticator 48 supplicant-timeout 30
no aaa port-access authenticator 48 client-limit
no aaa port-access mac-based 48
aaa port-access mac-based 48 addr-limit 1
```
